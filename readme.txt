This repo contains imported code of my Artificial Intelligence (CAP 4630) coursework from Google Colab. The assignments are as follows:

-----Assignment 1: Regression-----
Task is to develop two basic models with regression: one with Single Variable Nonlinear Regression and the other with Mutlivariable Linear Regression.

Libraries used include numpy and matplotlib.



-----Assignment 2: Logistic Regression-----
Task is to implement logistic regression/regularized logistic regression and apply it to two different datasets. We're to implement a sigmoid function and cross entropy cost function, 
map the features in regularized logistic regression into a higher dimension, and train parameters with Gradient Descent.

Libraries used include numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.



-----Assignment 3: Convolution Neural Network-----
Task is to go through some primary operations for image processing, and to implement one of the earliest but representative convolution neural networks: LeNet-5. Assignment expects data prep, 
implementation of the convolution filter, modification of the convolution scheme, implementation of MaxPooling, use of LeNet-5 to solve a classification problem with Fashion MNIST benchmarks.

Libraries include numpy, pandas, matplotlib, imageio, tensorflow (and keras).


-----Assignment 4: Recurrent Neural Network-----
Task is to implement a basic RNN network and an LSTM network with Keras to solve two problems: implementing a basic RNN network with Keras to predict time series, and building an LSTM model to conduct sentiment analysis. 

Libraries include numpy, tensorflow, and keras.


-----Assignment 5: Generative Adversarial Network-----
Task is to implement the basic GAN with Keras and TensorFlow. Assignment expects implementation of the Generative Adversarial Network with Keras, building the GAN model, compiling and training the model, 
evaluating the model, and plotting the generated samples.

Libraries include numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, and keras.
